<div align="center">DARPAN- An ML-based donation website ðŸš€ </div>
##ONGOING PROJECT!!

This project identifies and categorizes the objects being donated and updates their quantity in the organization's database. This will be done through object detection and classification of the image uploaded by a particular user. At the moment, the project does not  classify the images as being of good or bad quality.

The application is extremely useful to the users as they have the comfort of donating the objects easily through the ML-based object classification.

Our goal is really just to ease the donation purpose for the users and handling the donated goods in a systematic and efficient manner by the non profit organization.

This project is targeted towards potential donors and the non-profit organization.
The main purpose that our project would be fulfilling is to automate the process of donation and increase accessibility. This would encourage more people to donate from the comfort of their homes.
